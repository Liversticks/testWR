# PMD WR Tracker
Made by Liversticks (Oliver X.)

## Functionality
Run srcscrape.py to fetch the most recent world records for PMD speedrunning categories and store them in the SQLite database.
The Django backend handles retrieving and preparing the HTML templates.
HTML templates use Bootstrap to look nicer.
